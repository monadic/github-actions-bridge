## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Missing Headers
- All examples needed ConfigHub headers added:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: actions.confighub.com/v1alpha1
  kind: Actions
  metadata:
    name: example-name
  ```

### 2. Target Requirement
- Every `cub unit create` command MUST include `--target docker-desktop`
- Without target: "cannot invoke action on a unit without a target" error

### 3. ConfigHub URL
- Must use `https://hub.confighub.com` (NOT api.confighub.com)
- Wrong URL causes "no such host" error

### 4. PATH Configuration
- `cub` installs to `~/.confighub/bin/cub`
- Must add to PATH: `export PATH="$HOME/.confighub/bin:$PATH"`

## Next Steps

### Advanced Examples to Test:
- config-driven-deployment.yml (ConfigHub integration)
- time-travel-testing.yml (Historical configurations)
- workflow-diff-testing.yml (Workflow comparison)
- gitops-preview-improved.yml (GitOps workflows)

### AI Integration Examples:
- claude-orchestrated-ops.yml (Simulated)
- worker-calls-claude.yml (Simulated)

## Worker Performance

The actions-bridge worker performed excellently:
- Connected immediately to ConfigHub
- Executed all workflows without errors
- Maintained stable connection throughout testing
- Properly cleaned up after each execution

## Conclusion

The GitHub Actions Bridge successfully executes standard GitHub Actions workflows through ConfigHub. All core functionality works as expected once the proper headers and target are configured.
