# Security Considerations

## Overview

The GitHub Actions Bridge requires Docker access to execute workflows. This document outlines security considerations and best practices for deployment.

## Security Risks

### 1. Docker Socket Access

The default `docker-compose.yml` mounts the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) into the container. This is a significant security risk as it grants the container full control over the Docker daemon, equivalent to root access on the host.

**Risk Level: HIGH**

**Mitigation:**
- Use `docker-compose.secure.yml` for production deployments
- Implement Docker-in-Docker (DinD) for better isolation
- Consider using rootless Docker

### 2. AppArmor Disabled

The default configuration disables AppArmor (`apparmor:unconfined`) to allow act to function with the Docker socket. This removes an important security boundary.

**Risk Level: MEDIUM**

**Mitigation:**
- Use `docker-compose.secure.yml` which removes this requirement
- Create custom AppArmor profiles if needed

### 3. Container Privileges

Running containers with elevated privileges increases the attack surface.

**Risk Level: MEDIUM**

**Mitigation:**
- Drop unnecessary capabilities
- Run as non-root user when possible
- Use read-only root filesystem where applicable

## Secure Deployment Guide

### Development Environment

For development and testing, the default `docker-compose.yml` provides convenience but should only be used on trusted systems:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Production Environment

For production deployments, use the secure configuration:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.secure.yml up -d
```

Key security features:
- Docker-in-Docker for isolation
- No direct Docker socket access
- AppArmor enabled
- Runs as non-root user
- Dropped capabilities
- Resource limits

### Additional Security Measures

1. **Network Isolation**
   ```yaml
   networks:
     actions-bridge-net:
       driver: bridge
       internal: true  # No external network access
   ```

2. **Secrets Management**
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use Docker secrets or external secret management
   - Rotate credentials regularly

3. **Resource Limits**
   ```yaml
   deploy:
     resources:
       limits:
         cpus: '2'
         memory: 2G
   ```

4. **Monitoring and Auditing**
   - Enable logging for all workflow executions
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Regular security audits

## Workflow Security

### Untrusted Workflows

Never run untrusted workflows without review. Workflows can:
- Execute arbitrary code
- Access secrets
- Interact with external services
- Consume resources

### Best Practices

1. **Review all workflows** before execution
2. **Limit secret access** to only required workflows
3. **Use minimal base images** for containers
4. **Enable workflow signing** when available
5. **Implement timeout limits** for all executions

## Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Using `docker-compose.secure.yml` or equivalent
- [ ] Removed direct Docker socket access
- [ ] Enabled AppArmor or SELinux
- [ ] Running as non-root user
- [ ] Configured resource limits
- [ ] Implemented network isolation
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Reviewed all workflows
- [ ] Documented security procedures
- [ ] Tested incident response plan

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Email security@confighub.com with details
3. Include steps to reproduce if possible
4. Allow time for patch before disclosure

We take security seriously and will respond promptly to valid reports.
